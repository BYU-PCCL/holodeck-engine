  * AHolodeckTask
  * A base class for tasks within Holodeck.
  * This class chooses a HolodeckAgent which is trying to perform the task.
  * The task logic then sets the reward and terminal each tick.
  * The child class must remember to call the parent tick class at the end of
  * setting the reward and terminal. This allows the parent class to set those
  * variables in the shared memory.
