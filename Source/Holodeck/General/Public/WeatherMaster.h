* WeatherMaster
* The actor which is used to alter the state of weather/sky/fog/etc in the world.
*
* The WeatherMaster should not be spawned or placed in world. It is programmatically 
* spawned in the HolodeckGameModeBP and saved for later use.
*
* The weather master is fully implemented in its derived blueprint so it can have access
* to other BPs in the world which cannot be accessed in C++.
